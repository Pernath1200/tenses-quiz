Learn them as **whole phrases**.\n\nExamples: carry out (do), set up (establish), find out (discover), put off (postpone), run out of (use up).\n\nFor the full list, see **Reference → Phrasal verb dictionary**."

With pronoun: **Turn it on.** (not: Turn on it)\n\n**Inseparable:** object always after the particle.\n• Look **after** the children. (not: look the children after)\n• Run **into** a friend. Go **through** a difficult time.\n\nSee **Reference → Phrasal verb dictionary** to check which are which."

Use context.\n\nFull list: **Reference → Phrasal verb dictionary**."

Right: **Turn it on.** (Pronoun in the middle.)\n• **Say vs phrasal:** Wrong: I will *find* the information (search). Right: I will **look up** the information.\n• **Similar verbs:** look **up** (search) vs look **after** (take care of) vs look **for** (search for). See **Reference → Phrasal verb dictionary**."
