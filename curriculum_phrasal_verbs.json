        "title": "What are phrasal verbs?",
        "content": "A **phrasal verb** is a verb + a particle (a preposition or adverb) that together have a **meaning different** from the verb alone.\n\n• **look** = use your eyes → **look after** = take care of\n• **give** = hand something → **give up** = stop trying\n• **take** = get hold of → **take off** = remove (clothes); leave (plane)\n\nPhrasal verbs are very common in spoken and informal English. You need to learn them as whole phrases, not word by word.\n\nExamples: **carry out** (do), **set up** (establish), **find out** (discover), **look up** (search for), **put off** (postpone), **run out of** (use up)."

      {
        "title": "Separable vs inseparable",
        "content": "**Separable** phrasal verbs: the object can go **between** the verb and the particle, or **after** the particle.\n\n• **Turn on** the light. / **Turn** the light **on**.\n• **Pick up** the book. / **Pick** the book **up**.\n• When the object is a **pronoun** (it, them), it usually goes in the middle: **Turn it on.** **Pick it up.**\n\n**Inseparable** phrasal verbs: the object always comes **after** the particle.\n\n• **Look after** the children. (not *look the children after*)\n• **Run into** an old friend. (not *run an old friend into*)\n• **Go through** a difficult time.\n\nYou need to learn which phrasal verbs are separable and which are not. Use the **Phrasal verb dictionary** (View dictionary button) for reference."

      {
        "title": "Common patterns and particles",
        "content": "**Particles** often give a sense of direction or completion:\n\n• **up** – complete, increase: give up, set up, grow up, fill up\n• **down** – decrease, stop: calm down, turn down, shut down\n• **out** – disappear, distribute: find out, give out, run out\n• **off** – start/stop, disconnect: take off, turn off, call off\n• **on** – continue, connect: carry on, turn on, put on\n• **in** – enter, include: join in, bring in, fill in\n• **over** – transfer, review: take over, go over, think over\n• **through** – complete, examine: go through, look through\n\nMany phrasal verbs have **more than one meaning**: **take off** = remove clothes / leave (plane) / become successful. Context tells you which meaning."

        "title": "Typical Czech learner errors",
        "content": "• **Translating word for word:** Czech often uses a single verb where English uses a phrasal verb. Wrong: *I will find the information.* (if you mean search for it) Right: **I will look up the information.**\n\n• **Wrong particle:** Wrong: *We put on the meeting.* (postpone) Right: **We put off the meeting.** (put on = wear)\n\n• **Wrong word order (separable):** Wrong: *Turn on it.* Right: **Turn it on.** (Pronoun between verb and particle.)\n\n• **Using a single verb instead of phrasal:** Wrong: *I discovered the answer.* (OK but less natural in speech) More natural: **I found out the answer.**\n\n• **Confusing similar phrasal verbs:** **look up** (search) vs **look after** (take care of) vs **look for** (search for). **Take off** (remove; leave) vs **take out** (remove; extract). Use the dictionary to check meaning and examples."

        "title": "Quick summary",
        "content": "• Phrasal verb = **verb + particle** with a **special meaning** (e.g. give up = stop trying).\n• **Separable:** object can go in the middle (Turn **it** on). **Inseparable:** object after particle (look after **the children**).\n• Learn them as whole phrases. Use the **Phrasal verb dictionary** (top 50 + next 100) for reference, print and download.\n• This section has more practice and questions than other topics – use Part 2 and Part 3 sets to build confidence."
