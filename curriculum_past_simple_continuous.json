She left at five.\n• We talk about a **specific time** (yesterday, last week, at 3 o'clock, when...): I saw him yesterday. What did you do last night?\n• We tell a **sequence of events**: I got up, had breakfast, and went to work.\n• Short actions that **interrupt** a longer action: The phone rang while I was cooking. (rang = past simple)\n\nForm: regular verbs → **-ed**; irregular verbs → past form (went, saw, wrote)."

        "title": "When we use Past Continuous",
        "content": "Use the **past continuous** when:\n\n• An action was **in progress** at a moment in the past: At 8 pm I was watching TV. (I had started and was in the middle of it.)\n• We describe **background** or **longer** action when something else happened: I **was walking** home when I **met** an old friend. (walking = in progress; met = the event)\n• Two actions in progress at the same time (parallel): She **was cooking** while he **was setting** the table.\n• To show that something was **temporary** or **in progress** then: Last year she was working in London.\n\nForm: **was/were + verb + -ing** (was reading, were playing)."

(both in progress)\n• **While** she **was working**, the phone **rang**. (working = background; rang = event)\n\n**When** can be followed by past simple or past continuous: When I **arrived** (past simple), they **were having** dinner (past continuous)."

        "title": "Quick summary",
        "content": "• **Past simple** – completed actions, specific past time, sequence of events, short interrupting action. (did, went, saw)\n• **Past continuous** – action in progress at a moment in the past, background action, two parallel actions. (was/were + -ing)\n• **Interrupted:** Long action = past continuous; short event = past simple. (I was reading when the phone rang.)\n• **While** – often past continuous for the action in progress. **When** – past simple for the event, past continuous for the background."

        "title": "Typical learner errors",
        "content": "• **Using past simple for an action in progress:** Wrong: *I read when the phone rang.* (if you mean you were in the middle of reading) Right: **I was reading when the phone rang.**\n• **Using past continuous for a short completed action:** Wrong: *The phone was ringing when I was reading.* (if the phone rang once) Right: **The phone rang when I was reading.**\n• **Using past continuous for a finished time:** Wrong: *I was going to the cinema yesterday.* (if you mean you went and it's done) Right: **I went to the cinema yesterday.**\n• **Using two past simples for interrupted action:** Wrong: *I read when she called.* (unclear; were you in the middle of reading?) Right: **I was reading when she called.**\n\nTip: In progress at a moment = past continuous. Completed event or specific time = past simple."
