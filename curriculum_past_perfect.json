        "title": "What is the past perfect?",
        "content": "**Past perfect** = **had + past participle** (had gone, had finished, had written).\n\nIt describes an action that was **completed before** another past action or before a time in the past.\n\n• Past simple: I **left** at 5. (one past event)\n• Past perfect: When I arrived, she **had** already **left**. (she left before I arrived)\n\nExamples: He had finished his homework before dinner. By 2020 they had sold the house."
      },
      {
        "title": "When do we use it?",
        "content": "Use the past perfect when:\n\n• Something happened **before** another past action: When I got home, my sister **had cooked** dinner. (cooking was finished before I got home)\n• Something was true **by** a time in the past: By 9 o'clock she **had left**. I **had never been** there before 2020.\n• To give **cause or reason** in the past: I was tired because I **hadn't slept** well.\n\nOften used with: **before**, **by the time**, **when** (with past simple in the other clause), **already**, **never**."

        "title": "Form: had + past participle",
        "content": "**Positive:** subject + **had** + past participle — She had gone. They had finished.\n\n**Negative:** subject + **had not (hadn't)** + past participle — He hadn't seen it.\n\n**Question:** **Had** + subject + past participle? — Had you left before 5?\n\n**Past participle:** regular → -ed (finished, opened). Irregular → learnt list (gone, written, seen, left)."

      {
        "title": "Past perfect vs past simple",
        "content": "**Two past events:**\n• The one that happened **first** → past perfect.\n• The one that happened **later** (or is the main focus) → past simple.\n\nWhen I **arrived** (past simple – main event), the film **had already started** (past perfect – earlier).\n\nIf the order is clear from **before** / **after** / **when**, we sometimes use past simple for both: She **left** before I **arrived**. But past perfect is clearer: She **had left** before I arrived."
      },
      {
        "title": "Quick summary",
        "content": "• Past perfect = **had** + past participle. Use it for something **before** another past action or **by** a time in the past.\n• First past event → past perfect. Second/main event → past simple.\n• Typical: By the time..., When I got there..., She had already left. I had never seen it before."
      },
      {
        "title": "Typical errors",
        "content": "• **Using past simple for the earlier action:** Wrong: When I arrived, she *left*. Right: When I arrived, she **had left**.\n• **Using had with did:** Wrong: I *had went*. She *had didn't see* it. Right: I **had gone**. She **hadn't seen** it. (No did – had is the auxiliary.)\n• **Using past perfect for the main event:** Wrong: She had left when I had arrived. Right: She **had left** when I **arrived**.\n• **Overusing past perfect:** If the order is clear (e.g. She left before I arrived), past simple for both is fine.\n\nTip: Earlier past = had + participle. Later past = past simple."
