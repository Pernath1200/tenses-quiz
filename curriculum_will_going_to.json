We're going to meet on Friday.\n• You have an intention: She's going to buy a new car. They're going to move house.\n• You predict something from present evidence (you can see or know something now): Look at those clouds – it's going to rain. He's going to fall! (He's on the ice.)\n• Something is about to happen: The film is going to start in a minute.\n\nTip: If the plan or intention existed before the moment of speaking, use going to."

I'll help you with that.\n• You offer, promise, or refuse: I'll pay for the tickets. I won't tell anyone. I won't do it.\n• You make a general prediction (no present evidence): I think it will rain tomorrow. She'll probably be late.\n• You talk about future facts: The meeting will be at 3 pm. The train will leave at 10.\n• With think, hope, expect, probably, perhaps: I hope she will come. They'll probably agree.\n\nTip: If you just decided now, or you're offering/promising, use will."

I won't forget.\n\nSame situation, different meaning: 'I'll go to the gym tomorrow' (decision now) vs 'I'm going to go to the gym tomorrow' (I already planned it)."

        "title": "Typical Czech learner errors",
        "content": "Czech often uses the present tense or one future form where English distinguishes will and going to:\n\n• Using **will** for a plan you already made: Wrong: I will meet her tomorrow. (if you already arranged it) Right: I'm going to meet her tomorrow.\n• Using **going to** for a spontaneous decision: Wrong: (Phone rings) I'm going to get it. Right: I'll get it.\n• Using **will** when there is clear present evidence: Wrong: Look at the sky – it will rain. Right: Look at the sky – it's going to rain.\n• Using **going to** for offers: Wrong: I'm going to help you. (sounds like a plan) Right: I'll help you. (offer now)\n\nTip: Ask yourself: Did I decide before now? (going to) Or am I deciding now / offering? (will)"
