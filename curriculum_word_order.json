(subject **the answer** + verb **is**)\n• Can you tell me **where the station is**? (subject **the station** + verb **is**)\n• I wonder **when he left**. (subject **he** + verb **left**)\n\n**Wrong (Czech-style):** I don't know what **is the answer**. / I don't know where **is the station**.\n**Right (English):** I don't know what **the answer is**. / I don't know where **the station is**."
