        "content": "**Direct speech** repeats the exact words: *She said, \"I am tired.\"*\n\n**Reported speech** (indirect speech) reports what someone said without quotation marks. We usually change tenses, pronouns and time words:\n\n• Direct: \"I am tired.\" → Reported: She said (that) **she was** tired.\n• Direct: \"We will come.\" → Reported: They said (that) **they would** come.\n• Direct: \"I have finished.\" → Reported: He said (that) **he had** finished.\n\nWe use reporting verbs like **say**, **tell**, **ask**, **explain**. The word **that** after the verb is optional."

        "title": "Tense backshift",
        "content": "When the reporting verb is in the **past** (said, told, asked), we often **shift** the tense backwards:\n\n• Present simple → Past simple: \"I like it.\" → He said he **liked** it.\n• Present continuous → Past continuous: \"I am waiting.\" → She said she **was waiting**.\n• Past simple → Past perfect: \"I saw him.\" → He said he **had seen** him. (Or we keep past simple when the time is clear.)\n• Will → Would: \"I will help.\" → She said she **would** help.\n• Can → Could: \"I can swim.\" → He said he **could** swim.\n• Must → Had to (or kept): \"I must go.\" → She said she **had to** go.\n\nIf the situation is **still true** or **still in the future**, we sometimes keep the same tense (e.g. \"The Earth is round\" → He said the Earth **is** round). In exams and formal reporting we usually backshift."
