        "content": "Both tenses use have/has + past participle, but:\n\n• Present perfect SIMPLE: I have waited, she has read.\n• Present perfect CONTINUOUS: I have been waiting, she has been reading.\n\nThe choice depends on what you want to emphasise: the result of an action, how many times, how long something has been happening, or a visible effect now."

        "title": "When to use Present Perfect SIMPLE",
        "content": "Use the SIMPLE form when you focus on:\n\n• Completion or result: I've finished my homework. She's broken her phone.\n• How many / how much: I've read three books. He's sent five emails.\n• Life experience: Have you ever been to Japan?\n• Stative verbs (know, like, love, have, believe, want): I've known him for years. She's had that car since 2020.\n\nStative verbs describe states, not actions, so we don't use the continuous form with them."

      {
        "title": "When to use Present Perfect CONTINUOUS",
        "content": "Use the CONTINUOUS form when you focus on:\n\n• Duration (how long): I've been waiting for an hour. They've been living here since 2019.\n• An activity that is still going on or has just stopped: She's been studying all evening.\n• A visible or recent effect now: Why are your hands dirty? — Because I've been painting.\n• Temporary or repeated activity: We've been looking for a new flat for months.\n\nTime expressions like for, since, all day, lately often go with the continuous."
      },
      {
        "title": "Quick summary",
        "content": "• Result / how many / stative verb → SIMPLE (have + past participle).\n• Duration / how long / visible effect now → CONTINUOUS (have been + -ing).\n• When both are possible, the simple stresses the result; the continuous stresses the activity or the time spent."

        "title": "Typical Czech learner errors",
        "content": "Czech doesn't have the present perfect tense, so these mistakes are common:\n\n• Using past simple where present perfect is needed: Wrong: I never saw that film. Right: I've never seen that film. (life experience)\n• Using present perfect continuous with stative verbs: Wrong: I have been knowing him for years. Right: I have known him for years. (know, like, love, have, want = simple only)\n• Using present perfect with a finished time: Wrong: I have finished yesterday. Right: I finished yesterday. (yesterday → past simple)\n• Choosing continuous when the focus is result/count: Wrong: I have been read three books. Right: I have read three books. (how many → simple)\n\nTip: If you can add 'yesterday' or 'last week', use past simple. If you mean 'up to now' or 'so far', use present perfect."
