      "summary": "The present perfect simple highlights finished actions, results, and how many/how much, and is usually used with stative verbs like 'know', 'love', and 'have'. The present perfect continuous focuses on the duration or repetition of an activity and often explains a recent or visible effect now. With dynamic verbs, both forms are sometimes possible, but the continuous stresses the activity itself, while the simple stresses the result or completion.",
