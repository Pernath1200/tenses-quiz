After the meeting, he left.\n• **Before but, and, or, so, yet** when they join two full sentences: I called, but she was busy.\n• **Around extra (non-defining) information:** My brother, who lives in London, is a doctor.\n\nDo **not** use a comma when the information is essential (defining): The man who called yesterday left a message."

        "title": "Czech vs English – commas",
        "content": "**Differences that often cause mistakes:**\n\n• **Before že (that):** Czech often uses a comma before že. English usually does **not**: I think that he is right. (no comma before 'that' in most cases)\n\n• **Before and/but:** In English we use a comma when and/but joins two **full sentences**: She smiled, and I waved. If you only join two words or short phrases, no comma: She smiled and waved.\n\n• **Lists:** Czech may use a comma where English uses no comma (e.g. before a final item). In British English the last comma (before 'and') is optional."

(Czech: pondělí, březen – small letter)\n• **Nationalities and languages:** English, Czech, French.\n• **Titles of books/films:** (main words) The Lord of the Rings.\n\nDo **not** capitalise general nouns (e.g. 'university' unless part of a name: Oxford University)."

In Czech they are written with a small letter (pondělí, leden).\n\n• **I** – In English **I** is always a capital letter. In Czech 'já' is not capitalised.\n\n• **Nationalities/languages** – English, Czech, German (capital in English).\n\n• **First word after a colon** – In English it depends on style; often capital if a full sentence follows. In Czech often small letter."
