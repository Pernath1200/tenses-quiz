        "title": "What are prepositions?",
        "content": "Prepositions are short words that link a noun, pronoun or phrase to the rest of the sentence. They show relationships of **time** (when?), **place** (where?), **direction** (where to or from?), **manner** (how?), and more. You cannot translate them word-for-word from Czech – each preposition has many uses and English often chooses a different one.\n\nExamples:\n• Time: She arrives **at** 5 o'clock. We meet **on** Monday. I was born **in** 1995.\n• Place: The book is **on** the table. He lives **in** London. We'll meet **at** the bus stop.\n• Direction: I'm going **to** the station. She came **from** Paris. Put it **into** the box.\n• With verbs/adjectives: I'm interested **in** music. It depends **on** you. Made **by** hand."

        "title": "Typical Czech learner errors",
        "content": "Czech prepositions don't match English one-to-one, so these mistakes are common:\n\n• **Time:** Czech uses one preposition where English uses at/on/in. Wrong: I get up **on** 7 o'clock. She was born **at** 1995. Right: **at** 7 o'clock (exact time), **on** Monday (day), **in** 1995 (year). Remember: at + clock, on + day/date, in + month/year/season.\n• **Place:** Czech 'na' can mean on, at, or to. Wrong: The book is **at** the table. We meet **on** the bus stop. Right: **on** the table (surface), **at** the bus stop (point). In = inside; on = surface; at = point.\n• **Verbs + preposition:** Wrong: I'm interested **on** that. She's good **in** maths. It depends **from** the weather. Right: interested **in**, good **at**, depend **on**. These are fixed – learn them as chunks.\n• **Duration:** Wrong: I've lived here **since** three years. Right: **for** three years (duration) or **since** 2020 (start point).\n\nTip: Don't translate the preposition word for word – learn the English pattern."
