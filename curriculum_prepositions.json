They show the **relationship** between things: when, where, how, why, or in what way.\n\nThey answer questions like: **When?** (at 5 o'clock, on Monday). **Where?** (in the room, on the table, at the door). **Where to/from?** (to the station, from London). **How?** (by train, with a knife). **What about?** (talk about the project).\n\nEnglish often uses different prepositions than other languages – so don't translate word for word. Learn the English pattern (e.g. **in** the morning, **at** night)."

The plane took off.\n• **give up** (stop trying): Don't give up.\n• **look after** (take care of): She looks after the children.\n• **turn on** / **turn off** (switch): Turn on the light.\n• **find out** (discover): I found out the truth.\n\nYou cannot guess the meaning from the verb and preposition alone – **phrasal verbs must be learned**.
