        "content": "Past simple (I went, she finished) talks about a finished time in the past. Present perfect (I have been, she has finished) links the past to now – no specific past time, or the result is still relevant.\n\nThe choice often depends on time words: yesterday, last week, in 2019 → past simple. Ever, never, just, yet, already, since, for (with present meaning) → often present perfect."

        "title": "When we use Past Simple",
        "content": "Use the past simple when:\n\n• The time is finished and stated or clear: I saw him yesterday. She left in 2020.\n• We ask when something happened: When did you go? What time did it start?\n• We tell a story or sequence of past events: I got up, had breakfast, and left.\n\nTypical time expressions: yesterday, last week/month/year, ago, in 2019, when I was young."

        "title": "When we use Present Perfect",
        "content": "Use the present perfect when:\n\n• The exact time is not important or not said: I've been to Japan. She's lost her keys.\n• The result or situation is still relevant now: I've broken my phone (it's still broken).\n• We talk about life experience: Have you ever tried sushi?\n• With for/since (duration up to now): I've lived here for five years.\n\nTypical time expressions: ever, never, just, already, yet, for, since, so far, up to now."

      {
        "title": "Quick summary",
        "content": "• Finished past time (yesterday, last week, in 2019, when?) → Past simple (did, went, saw).\n• Past linked to now, no specific time, or result still true → Present perfect (have/has + past participle).\n• Don't use present perfect with a finished past time expression (wrong: I have seen him yesterday)."

      {
        "title": "Typical Czech learner errors",
        "content": "Czech has one past tense; English has past simple and present perfect. Czech learners often:\n\n• Use past simple with 'ever', 'never', 'yet', 'already' (life experience or 'up to now'): Wrong: I never saw him. Did you ever go to Paris? Right: I've never seen him. Have you ever been to Paris?\n• Use present perfect with a finished time: Wrong: I have seen him yesterday. When have you left? Right: I saw him yesterday. When did you leave?\n• Use present perfect when asking 'when?': Wrong: When have you been to London? Right: When did you go to London? (When? → past simple)\n• Use past simple with for/since when the situation continues now: Wrong: I lived here since 2020. Right: I've lived here since 2020.\n\nTip: Yesterday, ago, last week, in 2019, when? → past simple. Ever, never, just, yet, already, for, since (until now) → present perfect."
