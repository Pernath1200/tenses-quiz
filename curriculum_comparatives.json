        "title": "What are comparatives?",
        "content": "Comparatives are used to compare **two people, things or situations**. In English we usually add **-er** to short adjectives (taller, faster) or use **more + adjective** with longer adjectives (more interesting, more expensive). We often use **than** after a comparative: taller than, more expensive than.\n\nExamples:\n• My sister is **taller than** me.\n• This exercise is **easier than** the last one.\n• Prague is **smaller than** London.\n• This film is **more interesting than** the book."

      {
        "title": "How to form comparatives",
        "content": "1) **Short adjectives (1 syllable, and some 2-syllable like \"happy\")**\n• Add **-er**: tall → taller, long → longer, cheap → cheaper.\n• If the word ends in **-e**, just add **-r**: nice → nicer, large → larger.\n• If it ends **consonant + single vowel + consonant**, double the final consonant: big → bigger, hot → hotter, thin → thinner.\n• If it ends in **-y**, change y → i + **-er**: happy → happier, easy → easier, funny → funnier.\n\n2) **Long adjectives (usually 2+ syllables)**\n• Use **more + adjective**: more expensive, more difficult, more comfortable, more interesting.\n\n3) **Irregular comparatives**\n• good → **better**\n• bad → **worse**\n• far → **farther/further**\n• little → **less**\n• many/much → **more**"

        "title": "Using comparatives in sentences",
        "content": "We usually compare **A and B** with a comparative + **than**:\n\n• A comparative adjective + than:\n  – Tom is **taller than** his brother.\n  – Today is **colder than** yesterday.\n  – This task is **more difficult than** the last one.\n\nWe can also use **not as ... as** for negative comparisons:\n\n• She is **not as tall as** her sister. (= her sister is taller)\n• This exam is **not as hard as** the last one.\n\nWe can make the comparison stronger with words like **much, a lot, far**:\n\n• This book is **much better than** the film.\n• The new flat is **far bigger than** the old one."
      },
      {
        "title": "More comparative patterns (advanced)",
        "content": "At higher levels we use comparatives in more complex patterns:\n\n• **Comparatives with adverbs**: She speaks **more slowly than** before. He drives **faster than** his brother.\n• **Gradable differences**: a bit/slightly/rather vs much/a lot/far\n  – This test is **a bit easier than** the last one.\n  – The new system is **much more efficient than** the old one.\n• **The ... the ... structure**: The **more** you practise, the **better** your English gets. The **faster** we work, the **sooner** we can finish.\n• **Than + clause**: The meeting took longer than we **expected / thought / planned**.\n\nThese patterns help you sound more natural and precise when comparing things in advanced English."

        "title": "Superlatives – the best, the most, the least",
        "content": "Superlatives are used to compare **one person or thing with all the others in a group**. We usually use **the + superlative**:\n\n• Short adjectives: add **-est**\n  – tall → **the tallest**\n  – big → **the biggest** (double the final consonant)\n  – easy → **the easiest** (y → iest)\n\n• Long adjectives: **the most + adjective**\n  – **the most interesting**, **the most expensive**, **the most comfortable**\n\n• Irregular superlatives:\n  – good → **the best**\n  – bad → **the worst**\n  – far → **the farthest / the furthest**\n  – little → **the least**\n  – many/much → **the most**\n\nWe often use superlatives with expressions like **in + place/group** or **I’ve ever + past participle**:\n\n• She is **the tallest in the class**.\n• This is **the most difficult test I've ever done**.\n• It's **the best restaurant in town**.\n• That was **the worst day of my life**."

        "title": "Typical Czech learner errors",
        "content": "Czech often uses 'víc' with an adjective. In English we **cannot** usually put 'more' and '-er' together, and we must choose the correct pattern:\n\n• **Double comparative:** Wrong: *more easier*, *more better*, *more smaller*. Right: **easier**, **better**, **smaller**.\n• **More with short adjectives:** Wrong: *more tall*, *more cold*. Right: **taller**, **colder**.\n• **-er with long adjectives:** Wrong: *interestinger*, *expensiver*. Right: **more interesting**, **more expensive**.\n• **Missing \"than\":** Wrong: *She is taller me.* Right: **She is taller than me.**\n• **Using \"like\" instead of \"as\" in negative comparisons:** Wrong: *She is not so tall like her brother.* Right: **She is not as tall as her brother.**\n\nTip: Learn which adjectives are short (take -er) and which are long (more + adjective). Watch out for double comparatives (more + -er)."
