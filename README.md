## Console quiz (Python)

1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python present_perfect_quiz.py
   ```
3. Choose a **topic**, then **1) Part 1** (intro, rules & test), **2) Part 2** (practice), or **3) Part 3** (free practice – choose a set). Scores are saved automatically. After each section you can retry wrong answers; after a quiz you can export wrong answers to `review_wrong_answers.txt`.

## Web quiz

Use a local server (browsers don’t load local JSON when opening `index.html` directly):

1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. In your browser go to **http://localhost:8000** and open **index.html**.

Choose a **topic**, then **Part 1**, **Part 2**, or **Part 3**. Scores and progress are stored in the browser (localStorage).
