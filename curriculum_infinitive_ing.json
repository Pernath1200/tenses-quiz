        "content": "After many verbs we use either the **to-infinitive** (to do, to go) or the **-ing form** (doing, going). The choice depends on the verb – some verbs take only to-infinitive, some only -ing, and some take both (sometimes with a different meaning).\n\n• **To-infinitive**: I want to leave. She decided to apply. They hope to win.\n• **-ing form**: I enjoy swimming. She finished reading. He avoided answering.\n\nYou need to learn which pattern each verb takes."

She phoned to ask.\n\nExamples: I want to learn. She decided to stay. It's easy to forget."

She started to cry / She started crying.\n\nWith **prefer** we often say: I prefer to do X rather than (do) Y, or I prefer doing X to doing Y."

        "content": "With some verbs the meaning changes:\n\n• **remember**: remember to do = don't forget (future); remember doing = recall (past): I remembered to lock the door. I remember meeting him.\n• **forget**: forget to do = fail to do; forget doing = no memory of doing: I forgot to call. I'll never forget visiting Paris.\n• **stop**: stop to do = pause in order to do; stop doing = give up: We stopped to rest. She stopped smoking.\n• **try**: try to do = attempt; try doing = experiment: I tried to open it. Try adding salt.\n• **regret**: regret to do = sorry to say (e.g. I regret to inform you); regret doing = sorry about past: I regret leaving."

        "title": "Quick summary",
        "content": "• **Want, decide, hope, promise, need, try (attempt)** → to-infinitive.\n• **Enjoy, finish, avoid, mind, suggest, consider** → -ing.\n• **Like, love, start, begin** → both (similar meaning).\n• **Remember, forget, stop, try, regret** → both but meaning changes (learn each pair).\n• After a preposition → always -ing: interested in learning, good at swimming."

        "title": "Typical Czech learner errors",
        "content": "Czech often uses infinitive or a different structure where English uses to-infinitive or -ing:\n\n• Using -ing after **want**: Wrong: I want learning English. Right: I want to learn English.\n• Using to-infinitive after **enjoy**: Wrong: I enjoy to read. Right: I enjoy reading.\n• Using to-infinitive after **look forward to** (to is a preposition here): Wrong: I look forward to see you. Right: I look forward to seeing you.\n• Confusing **remember to do** vs **remember doing**: Wrong: I remembered locking the door (if you mean you didn't forget). Right: I remembered to lock the door.\n\nTip: Learn verbs in groups – want/hope/decide = to-infinitive; enjoy/finish/avoid = -ing."
