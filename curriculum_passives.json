(We care about the hospital, not who opened it.)\n  – The report has been finished. (We care that it's done.)\n\n• **In formal or academic writing:**\n  – The experiment was carried out in a controlled environment.\n  – It is believed that the situation will improve.\n\nIf we want to say who did the action we use **by + agent**: The window was broken **by the storm**."

(We know the police do this.)\n• The meeting was postponed. (We don't need to say who did it.)\n\nSome passive verbs take a different preposition (not by):\n• I'm **interested in** this topic.
